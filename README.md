# Topic Modeling over Dutch COVID-19 Tweets

## Introduction

## Data

The tweets used in this project are not mined by myself.
The tweets are obtained from [Twiqs](https://ifarm.nl/erikt/talks/2015enschede-1.pdf), and the dataset specifically used in this project has been gathered by [other researchers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07283).
Because this is not my data, the folder containing this data is not in this git repository.
